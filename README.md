### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Mike Crawford and I am a cybersecurity student and Coastline Community College in Garden Grove, California. 

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on obtaining industry certifications and participating in CTF events
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to program in Python and C++ through an amalgam of online learning, college coursework, and banging my head against the keyboard 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects once I develop the appropriate skills. I would never have discovered my passion for computer science had it not been for the open source community. I feel indebted, and would be honored to contribute something meaningful to a project some day.
