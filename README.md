### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mike Crawford and I am a cybersecurity student and Coastline Community College in Garden Grove, California. I have a passion to help businesses deploy technologies that allow them to operate at their best. My dream is to become a Cloud Architect who drives the strategy, implementation, and deployment of secure cloud applications.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on obtaining industry certifications and learning the basics of Web Development with a focus on developing secure applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to program in Python and Javascript through an amalgam of online learning, college coursework, and banging my head against the keyboard à²¥â€¿à²¥
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects once I develop the appropriate skills. I would never have discovered my passion for programming had it not been for the open source community. I feel indebted, and would be honored to contribute something meaningful to a project some day.
